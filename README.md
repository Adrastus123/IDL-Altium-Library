# IDL Altium Library

This is a altium library starter for the altium library.  It is research/development of PCB electronics purpose online.    

## Getting Started

To get started,  Follow the instruction provided PDF for the altium program.   (Instruction May vary due to different version.)

If you have problem,  I would suggest ask about how to install or set up the floating licence.   

Instruction will be for the Altium 18 (since that is what is installed on most of the workstation.)

### Prerequisites

Window with Altium 18 installed (Possibly later version, however, installation process maybe vary.)

List of that system that worked. (so far)
```
OS Name	Microsoft Windows 7 Professional
OS Name	Microsoft Windows 10
```

### Installing

**Global Installation (All project will be able to access this )** <br>
Open Altium. 
Installing the library first located the panel on the right bottom left click then navigate to Libraries.

On pop-up "Available libraries" window's tab,  select the installed tab.  Naigate the bottom-right corner of the popup window,  click the installed and naivgate to the file downloaded file.  (Be sure of the location of the file.  If you move the file,  Altium will complain that you moved the alitum library location so beware and placed them in a safe location.).  Highlight all and click ok. 

Should be able to see the listed in the installation file. As shown in below.

## Running the tests

Suggestion is to test the compoenent on library to be sure that there is no feature problem before updating your layout.   Place a component from the newly install on the schamtic and try updating the layout.   if you see the part's foot print.  you done it! :)
